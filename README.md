HUNTER - Habitable zone UNcerTainty EstimatoR

This code performs an MC sampling to estimate what fraction of rocky planets could harbor liquid water on their surfaces. HUNTER is described in detail in (Zsom, 2014, under review). The code uses precalculated all-convective T-P profiles from a 1D climate code described in (Zsom et al., 2013). Currently HUNTER comes with tables for H2, N2, and CO2 dominated atmospheres.
